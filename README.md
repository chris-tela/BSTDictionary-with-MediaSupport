**Project Overview**

This project implements an ordered dictionary using a Binary Search Tree to store and manipulate information efficiently. The primary goal is to create a file-explorer-like process where files are organized and sorted based on their file types (e.g., .txt, .gif, .wav, etc.). This system allows users to view, manage, and "play" supported files directly within the console.

**Features**

File Sorting by Type:
Files are sorted within the dictionary based on their file type, allowing users to easily organize their files by type (e.g., text files, image files, audio files, etc.).

BST Implementation:

An efficient Binary Search Tree is used to store the files in the dictionary. The tree ensures that files can be retrieved, added, and removed in logarithmic time, making the system scalable and efficient for handling large numbers of files.

File Playback:
The system supports "playing" files that are compatible with specific file types. For example, users can open text files in the console, view images (in an ASCII representation or similar), and play audio files in a supported format directly from the command line.
